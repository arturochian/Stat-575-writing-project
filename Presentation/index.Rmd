## Introduction

```{r setup, message = F, warning = F, error = F, echo = F, tidy = F, cache = F}
# setwd("~/School/Stat 575 - Writing Project/Presentation/pres_slidify")
require(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(message = F, warning = F, error = F, results = 'markup',
  tidy = F, cache = F, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5, 
  fig.align = "center", comment = "", echo = FALSE)

We are interested in how much pitchers in baseball value individual statistics.

> * Does an individual statistic (like ERA) have an influence on the pitcher that is not beneficial to team level performance?

---
## Background

* Pope, Devin G., and Maurice E. Schweitzer. "Is Tiger Woods loss averse? Persistent bias in the face of experience, competition, and high stakes." The American Economic Review 101.1 (2011): 129-157.

* Parsons, Christopher A., et al. "Strike three: discrimination, incentives, and evaluation." The American Economic Review 101.4 (2011): 1410-1435.

---
## The Idea

> * ERA is an individual-level statistic that is used to evaluate pitchers in baseball

> * But, there are certain situations where ERA doesn't apply

> * Do pitchers pitch differently in these situations than when it does apply?

## The Idea

<iframe src='http://m.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=19792187&topic_id=6479266&width=800&height=500&property=mlb' width='800' height='500' frameborder='0'>
</iframe>

<!--
The fielder should have caught the ball so this batter should have been out.  The batter reached on base through an error so the pitcher isn't responsible for him.  As a result, the pitcher's ERA isn't affected if this batter scores.

There are other situations in baseball where the pitcher is not resposible if the batter scores, but I won't go into detail with those.

## The Idea

### Do pitchers pitch differently when they are responsible for the men on base than when they are not responsible? ###

## The Data

Thanks to MLB, we have information on where each pitch is thrown.

## The Data

A 2D density estimation of 96,410 pitches of LHP vs LHB

```{r alldata, fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
setwd("~/School/Stat 575 - Writing Project/R_Code_Data/Final_Stuff")
load("LvL_Data.Rdata")
p1 <- ggplot(pit_LvL, aes(x = px, y = pz)) + 
  stat_density2d(geom = "tile", contour = FALSE, 
               aes(fill = ..density.., alpha = ..density..)) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=-0.8, y=1.5, xend = -0.8, yend = 3.5)) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=-0.8, y=3.5, xend = 0.8, yend = 3.5)) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=0.8, y=3.5, xend = 0.8, yend = 1.5)) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=0.8, y=1.5, xend = -0.8, yend = 1.5)) + 
  guides(fill = FALSE, alpha = FALSE) + theme_bw() + 
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "#FF99FF", high = "#FF0000") + 
  labs(x = "Horizontal Location", 
  y = "Vertical Location", 
	title = "Pitch Locations for LHP vs LHB")
p1
```


---
## Methodology

Ideally, we'd like to say that whether or not a pitcher is responsible affects pitch location

$resp \rightarrow (x,z)$ where (x,z) is the pitch location

> * For example
```{r demo, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 7}
ggplot() + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = rnorm(1000, -3), y = ..density..), 
                 colour = "darkgreen", fill = "lightgreen") + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = rnorm(1000, 3), y = ..density..), 
                 colour = "darkred", fill = "lightsalmon2") + 
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(x = "X", y = "") + xlim(-6, 6)
```


> * $(x,z) \rightarrow resp$



```{r expl2, eval=FALSE}
That is, different locations are associated with different probabilities of a pitcher being responsible
```

---
## Methodology

Our basic model uses location as the explanatory variable and whether or not the pitcher is responsible as the response variable


$Y \sim Bin(1, \pi)$



$logit(\pi) = \beta_0 + f(x,z) + \epsilon$



Where $f(x,z)$ is a smoothed function of $x$ and $z$

## What We'd Expect...

If there is not a relationship

```{r ecpectNo, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
loc.no <- expand.grid(
  px = seq(-1, 1, by = .05), 
  pz = seq(-1, 1, by = .05))
loc.no$prog <- (-.5 * loc.no$px ^ 2 - .5 * loc.no$pz ^ 2) / 100 + 0.1
loc2.no <- dcast(loc.no, px ~ pz, value.var = "prog")
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
persp3D(seq(-1, 1, by = .05), 
        seq(-1, 1, by = .05), 
        as.matrix(loc2.no[, -1]), zlim = c(0, 1), 
        colkey = FALSE, colvar = NULL, 
        xlab = "Horizontal Location", ylab = "Vertical Location", 
        zlab = "Probability not Responsible", 
        phi = 15, clab = "Probability", expand = .8)
```

If there is a relationship

## Modeling with GAMs

GAMs are models which use smoothers to fit a regression model

*** =left
```{r gamex, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=4, eval = T}
require(ggplot2)
require(mgcv)
x1 <- runif(100, 0, 20)
x2 <- runif(100, 0, 10)
y1 <- (220 - 8 * x1 - 3 * x1^2 + 0.4 * x1^3 - 0.012 * x1^4) / 100 + 
  rnorm(100, 0, .3)
qplot(x1, y1) + theme_bw()
```

```{r gamex_mod, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=4, eval = T}
fit1 <- gam(y1 ~ s(x1, k = 5, bs = "ts"))
plot(fit1, residuals = TRUE)
```


*** =right

```{r gamex2, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=4}
x2 <- runif(100, 0, 10)
y2 <- 2 - 1.35 * x2 + 0.5 * x2^2 - 0.038 * x2^3 + rnorm(100, 0, .3)
qplot(x2, y2) + theme_bw()
```

```{r gamex2_mod, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=4, eval = T}
fit2 <- gam(y2 ~ s(x2, k = 5, bs = "ts"))
plot(fit2, residuals = TRUE)
```

## Modeling with GAMs: Simulated Interactions

edf = 17.26, p-value for a test of a null hypothesis of a flat surface is $<0.00001$

```{r gamex3, fig.height = 6, fig.width=9}
 y3 <- y1 + y2 - 0.05 * x1 * x2
fit3 <- gam(y3 ~ te(x1, x2, bs = "ts", k = 5))
vis.gam(fit3)
```


---
## Revisiting What We Expect

```{r expectYesAgain, fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
loc <- expand.grid(
  px = seq(-1, 1, by = .05), 
  pz = seq(-1, 1, by = .05))
loc$prog <- (-.5 * loc$px ^ 2 - .5 * loc$pz ^ 2 + 1.5) / 20
loc2 <- dcast(loc, px ~ pz, value.var = "prog")
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
persp3D(seq(-1, 1, by = .05), 
        seq(-1, 1, by = .05), 
        as.matrix(loc2[, -1]), zlim = c(0, 0.2), 
        colkey = FALSE, 
        xlab = "Horizontal Location", ylab = "Vertical Location", 
        zlab = "Probability not Responsible", 
        phi = 15, clab = "Probability", expand = .8)
```

## $\pm 2$ SEs

```{r SEs, fig.width=10, fig.height=7}
setwd("~/School/Stat 575 - Writing Project/R_code_data/Final_Stuff")
load("LvL_model.Rdata")
vis.gam(fitL.L, c("px", "pz"), se = 2)
```

edf = 5.96; p-value $\approx 0.001$

---
## Future Work

* Try to control for some additional covariates
* Maybe try a different approach
* Work on interpretation for other handedness combinations

---
## Conclusion

> * We wanted to see if pitch location is related to whether or not the pitcher is responsible for the men on base
> * We found that there is a relationship
> * This suggests that pitchers may pitch differently based on whether or not their ERA can be affected
